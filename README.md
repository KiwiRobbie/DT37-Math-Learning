# DT37-Math-Learning

This program depends on the non-core pyglet module, this is included with the project files although it can also be installed using pip.

`py -3.9 -m pip install pyglet`

The program is also written for python version 3.9 and may not function correctly in other python versions, links to python 3.9:

All code in the pyglet folder is not owned by me, it is included for compatibility and I take no credit for it. Pyglet is freely avalible through Pypip.
