        ["<txt>","So what is an imaginary number? Well it is defined as i times another number, i was created by mathematicians to represent the square root of -1, this is a value that can't be shown with normal numbers."],
        ["<txt>","When we think about the number line, 1 represents a single step in the positive direction ( This can be thought of a moving to the right ). Multiplying 1 by another number represents that many steps to the right. On the regular number line we also have -1, multiplying a number by -1 represents that many steps in the negative direction, typically to the left."],
